Time spent: ~4 hours each

Contains:
    - Three files: osp2a.cpp, osp2b.cpp, osp2c.cpp. These three files correlate to part a, b, and c of project 2, respectively. 

Difficulties:
    - Neither of us ran into any great difficulties when working on this project.
    The PowerPoint that is on eCollege did a very good job of explaining the basics
    of PThreads.

Problems: There are no known errors.
